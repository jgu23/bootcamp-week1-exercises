          <h1>Since time immemorial</h1>
          <p class="lead">
            the many species of Bird™ have fought for dominance. When the One Great Bird™
            fell from the heavens into the mortal realm, that eldritch being dissolved into the effervescent Eagle,
            the devious Duck, the ferocious Falcon, the proud Penguin, the cynical Chicken, the opulent Owl,
            and many, many more, whose names have been lost to the ravages of times. Before Order and Chaos,
            before Time and Space, before Land and Sea, the Bird™ War has raged, at times threatening to tear
            the fabric of reality itself apart. <br> <br> After the Fourth Great Calamity of the Phaethonic Period,
            the First Council of Birds™ convened, with a single representative from each of the Bird™ Species,
            and they turned their beaks to the skies, and called to the heavens for an answer, a solution to the
            struggle. And from the heavens came the response: that if the Birds™ could not decide for themselves
            by the next alignment of the stars, the world itself would end, and all Birds™ would be no more. <br>
            <br> And now the alignment of the stars draws near. Facing this most grave of fates, the 78th convention
            of the Twelfth Council of Birds™ has issued a truce, and declared that the greatest Bird™ shall be
            determined amongst the current four most powerful species: the Chicken, the Duck, the Goose, and the
            Emu. <br><br> And so we gather here to vote upon which Bird™ shall reign supreme for the rest of Time.

          <p class="lead">You must choose. History is watching us. It was watching as you browsed
          this website. It was watching as you ate breakfast this morning. It watches as the hand of
          Time ticks ever closer to the next alignment of the stars. And history, my friends, is
          written by the victors. The Birds™ that win shall have free reign to write their own
          history. A history in which no One Great Bird™ fell from the skies, but rather the Duck or
          the Goose, the Emu or the Chicken. None of us know why we’re here. None of us know why
          we’re choosing. We just woke up here, knowing only that a victor must be chosen (via this
          handy-dandy embedded Google Form!). The final battle has begun, so let me say now, because
          I won’t get a chance later, that it was an honor to stand by your side, however briefly.
          Thank you, thank you all. And now choose, as if your life depended on it, because it does.
          <br><br>End the Bird™ Wars.<br><br>End the Bird™ Wars, before the End of the World.</p>
